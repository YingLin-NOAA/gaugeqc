[The gauge QC eval output] 
Lists station IDs followed by a 27-digit code (14 digits _ 12 digits)
which indicates the reason(s) for being flagged as potentially
problematic and a count of failures, decoded as follows:

a) Type of failure(s):

   column  1: overall evaluation (1=fail, 2=pass)
   column  2: station location info source (1=nwsli/dcp, 2=not found,
              3=data file)
   column  3: daily report count (0= >= 3 obs, 1= < 3 obs)
   column  4: hourly observation > 4.00" (0=no 1=yes)
   column  5: consecutive observations >= 2" (0=no, 1=yes)
   column  6: daily sum > 12.00" (0=no, 1=yes)
   column  7: >=2 daily sums >= 5.00" (0=no, 1=yes)
   column  8: monthly sum >= 20.00" (0=no, 1=yes)
   column  9: monthly sum >= (2 * climatological monthly sum) when
              climatological monthly sum >= 3.00" (0=no, 1=yes) NOT USED
   column 10: excessive missing observations for day (0=no, 1=yes)
   column 11: >= 35 missing observations for month (0=no, 1=yes) NOT USED
   column 12: stuck gage (repeated value) (0=no, 1=yes)
   column 13: daily station neighbor check (0=pass, 1=fail)
   column 14: hads neighbor check (0=pass, 1=fail, 9=not done)
   column 15: _

b) Count of failures (past 30 days):

   columns 16-17: insufficient number of observations (sum cols
                  3,10,11)
   columns 18-19: hourly observation anomaly (sum cols 4,5)
   columns 20-21: daily sum anomaly (sum cols 6,7)
   columns 22-23: monthly sum anomaly (sum cols 8,9)
   columns 24-25: gauge problem (column 12)
   columns 26-27: neighbor failure (sum cols 13,14)
